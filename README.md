LinearRegression.java :
It is a Model for Linear Regression for Single Variable. Let x and y be two Variables and y is dependent of x.

So Using this code Follow up Following Command to Predict y on basis of x:

1. Clone this in your System.
2. Go to cmd and javac this file to create a .class file.
3. Now Type java LinearRegression "FileName Containing the Data Seprated by Space."
  Example
  Experience        Salary
      3               30
      8               57
      9               64
      13              12
      3               36
      6               43
      11              59
      21              90
      1               20
      16              83
      
4. Experience is the variable x and y is salary which is dependent on the x.
    y=w0+w1*x

5. Type the value asked for Experience and Salary will be Predicted.
6. You can use any type of data of 2 variables.
Eg. Housing Rate Prediction on Basis of Area etc..
